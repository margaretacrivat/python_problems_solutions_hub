# Task:  Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.

# Hint: Remove first n characters from a string.
# Remove_chars("python", 4) so output must be "on". Here we need to remove first four characters from a string.

# Solution:
chars = "python"
remove_4 = chars[4:]
print(remove_4)
